### Datasets

- __[The Database of Faces (ORL)]([url](https://cam-orl.co.uk/facedatabase.html))__: contains a set of face images taken between April 1992 and April 1994 at the AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. There are ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting, facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with tolerance for some side movement).
- __[MNIST]([url](http://dia.fi.upm.es/~lbaumela/PracRF11/MNIST.html))__: The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
